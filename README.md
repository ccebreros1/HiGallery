# HiGallery

This app will keep your pictures protected whenever you take photos from it. 
It uses fingerprint, if you have a compatible phone with android 6.0 and above, to keep the pictures saved on this gallery 
protected all the time, so just you and whoever you trust to have his or her fingerprint on the device have access to the 
photos. This is an open source project, and anybody can make changes by forking, branching or using the code of this repository.
